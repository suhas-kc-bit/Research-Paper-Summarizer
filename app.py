Constructed in 1632, it is famous for its stunning white marble architecture, intricate designs, and symmetrical layout. The structure includes a large central dome, four minarets, a mosque, a guest house, and beautifully laid-out gardens in the Charbagh style. Its design combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architecture. Built over 22 years by more than 20,000 workers, the monument also features detailed inlay work using precious stones. In 1983, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. Despite environmental challenges, preservation efforts continue. Today, the Taj Mahal remains a powerful symbol of love, architectural excellence, and India‚Äôs rich heritage, attracting millions of visitors every year."
